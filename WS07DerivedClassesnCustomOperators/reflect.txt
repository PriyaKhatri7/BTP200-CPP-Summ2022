Workshop 7:
I couple of the things I learned in this workshop was practising using the operators << and >> with
ostream and istream.

As well as when coping the string over for address since the instructions asked to store Factory, there
is a built-in function that I used which is c_str which copies string to array.

Another thing that I learned and got to put in practise was inheriting from the base class in the header
for the Truck module. Since it's automatically private, I have to check again and make sure to use public
which was giving me errors and not letting me use data from the MotorVehicle function.

Milestone 2:
I was facing alot of difficulties with my custom constructor because that is where the program starts.
At first I was getting the output similar to this:
loading data from ParkingData.csv
Error in data file
loading data file

I found that there was an error from my constructor and running through the debugger I found that it wasn't
also checking for a null string which is why I wasn't getting error twice at the top. 

Also through the program when I would get to 4 it wouldn't output the line with multiple "@" coming
from the main but it wasn't unless I entered 4 in my program again. So I figured out it was one of my
loops in the exit function that I had to fix. Included a picture for reference.

 


Lastly having alot of leaks that I have to go through and figure out where I need to deallocate memory
using the debugger

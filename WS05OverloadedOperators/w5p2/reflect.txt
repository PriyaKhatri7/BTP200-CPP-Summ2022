I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshopsand assignments.


- Explain why the word explicit is important and what happens if we remove it for the operator bool()
From my understanding the keyword explicit is specifically used for conversion functions 
operators and constructors. This makes the code less prone to errors. This keyword declares 
explicit conversion to a type. 
The program needed to remove the keyword for this function because it's used for automatic 
conversions and explicit says that conversion cannot be used in "automatic" conversion.
The means that potentially other data types can be changed as well as it's required because it
stops that.

- Explain why this friend helper operator cannot be a member of the class.
The operator< isn't a part of the Ship class because if it's a meber of the class it will give 
you an error since you cannoy have more than 2 arguments/parameters whilst being a member of a 
class.

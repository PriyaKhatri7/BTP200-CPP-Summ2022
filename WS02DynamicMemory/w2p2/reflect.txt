One issue I was having was a syntax error specifically for my Wrapping* m_wrap pointer. I figured 
that that it needed to be initialized and also i should put my struct Wrapping before my struct 
Gift because it wasn't recognizing the Wrapping type since it was after. 

I also have confusion when it comes to deallocating because i'm never sure which parameter to deallocate.
I learned during the unwrap function and debugging because on line where i'm allocating memory for m_wrap the gift 
in function "wrap" then on the "unwrap" function since you are deleting (unwrapping the gift) you set 
the layers to 0 and delete the memory. 

Alot of my confusions was from allocating and deallocating memory last year which I think in this workshop I 
went through the debugger and seeing how the values in memory gets stored and when it should get thrown out. 
During this workshop I got to practice this skill.
